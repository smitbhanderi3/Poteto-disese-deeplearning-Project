## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of images of healthy and diseased potato plants. It includes the following classes of diseases:
- Early Blight
- Late Blight
- Healthy (No Disease)

## Methods
We utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build a robust disease detection model. The following steps were taken in the project:
1. Data Preprocessing: Image data was cleaned, normalized, and augmented to improve model performance.
2. Model Architecture: We designed a CNN architecture that can accurately classify the potato plant images into their respective disease categories.
3. Training: The model was trained on a labeled dataset of potato plant images.
4. Evaluation: We evaluated the model using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Deployment: We created a user-friendly web interface for the trained model for easy disease detection.

## Results
Our trained model achieved an accuracy of [mention accuracy here]% on the test dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in detecting potato diseases. The model can classify images into their respective disease categories, enabling early disease detection and intervention.

## Usage
To use the Potato Disease Detection model, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the provided Python script for inference on your potato plant images.
4. Obtain disease predictions for your images.
